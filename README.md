<h1 align="center">Swaglandia Balatro Edition: Playing Cards</h1>

![title](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fb4c937-7fc7-4bfc-b82a-e5a77baab5d9)

This is a texture replacement for members of Swaglandia,
specifically for all playing cards. All card artwork is done
by Robely with minimal edits by MulliganMayhem for High Contrast
card alts. This is meant to be used with Balatro Mod Manager, but
works normally without it.

## Key Features
	-Ace, King, Queen, Jack card replacement
	-Low Contrast and High Contrast alts
 	-Matching UI for Card Symbols when using HC cards

## Prerequisites
Other than Balatro itself, the following tools and mods are required:

0. [Lovely (>=0.6)](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) (Lua injector, required for Steamodded)
1. [Steamodded (>=1.0.0~alpha)](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) (mod loader, required for Malverk)
2. [Malverk (>=1.0)](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk) (texture pack manager, required for _this_ mod)

If you already have a modded instance of Balatro, you only need to install Malverk!

## Installation
Like any other Steamodded-based Balatro mod, put this mod in the `Mods`
directory in the Balatro `AppData` directory, alongside Steamodded and Malverk.
Either Click the '<>Code' and download as a .zip _or_ download from the
[Releases](https://github.com/MulliganMayhem/SwaglatroPlayingCards/releases) page

## Usage
Apply the textures in the Malverk `Textures` menu inside `Options`.
